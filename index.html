            I was raised in a an area of greater Boston. I made a few attempts to
            become a programmer and tried out different online courses and
            bootcamps but never succeeded. Then, I met Elise, a programming guru.
            So now I have grown more serious about it and I hope to make it all
            the way through Practicum. However, My motivation can be a little
            unstable and he often gets distracted by his versatile other interests
            in life.
