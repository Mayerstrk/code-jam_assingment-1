          I was raised in a an area of greater Boston. I made a few attempts to
          become a programmer and tried out different online courses and
          bootcamps but never succeeded. Then, I met Elise, a programming guru.
          So now I have grown more serious about it and I hope to make it all
          the way through Practicum. However, My motivation can be a little
          unstable and he often gets distracted by his versatile other interests
          in life.
